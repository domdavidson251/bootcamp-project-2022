                <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine seasoning ingredients</li>
                <li>Cut the chicken into 3/4 inch pieces and season it in Lemon Pepper Seasoning. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook on each side for 2-3 minutes, until a brown crust has developed. Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted pasta water to a boil while you begin to prepare the sauce as outlined below.</li>
                <li>Add the white wine to the same pot that you used to cook the chicken and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom of the pot. Let it reduce by half, about 4 minutes. </li>
                <li>Add the butter and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
                <li>Add chicken broth in small splashes, stirring continuously. Add the half and half in the same manner, then add the hot sauce and seasonings. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cover it partially.</li>
                <li>Boil the pasta to al dente according to package instructions. Add the broccoli to the boiling pasta water during the last 4 minutes, then drain</li>
                <li>Reduce heat of sauce to low and slowly stir in the grated cheese.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Add the pasta, broccoli, and the chicken and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt if desired. Serve!</li>
