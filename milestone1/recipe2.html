                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
                    <li>Add ground beef to large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and crumble it for 3 minutes.Add the seasonings, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and the onions and cook for 5 more minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Tilt the skillet and spoon out any excess grease. Reduce heat to low.</li>
                    <li>Spread 3/4 cup of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish and add the rest to the skillet with the meat. Add the half and half and stir to combine. Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Arrange half of the ravioli on the bottom of the casserole dish and top with half of the meat sauce, then top with ½ cup mozzarella cheese.</li>
                    <li>Top with remaining ravioli, then the meat sauce and remaining mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Cover and bake for 35 minutes. If covering with foil, spray one side with non-stick cooking spray to prevent it from sticking to the cheese while it bakes.</li>
                    <li>Remove cover and broil at 450 to brown the top slightly. It’ll take just 1-2 minutes, watch it closely during this time.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and serve!</li>
